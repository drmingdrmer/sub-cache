//! Continuous write consistency integration test
//!
//! This test validates that a distributed cache maintains consistency when subjected to
//! continuous writes from a background task. The key aspects being tested are:
//!
//! 1. **Real-time Consistency**: Cache state remains consistent at any point in time
//! 2. **Continuous Updates**: Cache correctly handles ongoing data source changes
//! 3. **Delete/Recreate Cycles**: Cache properly handles key deletion and recreation
//! 4. **Sequence Ordering**: All cached values maintain proper sequence number ordering
//! 5. **Multi-key Consistency**: Multiple keys are kept in sync simultaneously
//!
//! The test simulates a production scenario where data is constantly being updated
//! in the underlying data source while the cache must maintain a consistent view.
